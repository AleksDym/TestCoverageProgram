# TestCoverageProgram

This is a program that performs the mcdc and mmbu algorithms on a given truth table from .md file. 
More info on mcdc: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage
 
The user enters input path-output path - desired output file format - desired algorithm and recieves the file with chosen by the algorithm cases.

### Basic functionality:

- Both algoirthms can be performed at the same time
- several files can be processed at the same time
- Truth tables with arbitrary amount of conditions can be processed
